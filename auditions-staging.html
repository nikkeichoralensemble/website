      <h2>What is it like to be a member?</h2>
      <p>Our practices this semester will be on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:30-8:30 PM, as well as on Saturdays
        from 4-6 PM. Each one is a chance for members to develop their singing fundamentals, work on music and choreo,
        and improve together as a group! Outside of practice, we have a retreat every semester, as well as solo
        workshops where members get to sing and receive feedback on songs of their choice. We also perform at various
        live events!

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details>
        <summary> Q: Do I have to be Japanese to join? </summary>
        <p>Nope! And no Japanese language knowledge is necessary, either. </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary> Q: What does an audition entail? </summary>
        <p>Auditions consist of several basic warm-up and learning exercises that you can complete regardless of your
          level of musical experience! The only thing you need to come prepared with is a short 1 minute solo of your
          choice. If you are invited back for our second round of auditions, we will also ask that you learn a short
          excerpt of a specific piece beforehand.</p>
        <p>After you sign up for an audition slot, we’ll send you an email with more specific details :)</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary> Q: What if I don't know my vocal part? </summary>
        <p>We'll help you figure it out during the audition!</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary> Q: What if I don't have any prior experience? </summary>
        <p>No prior experience is required. We're all learning together! We just ask that you be willing to put in the
          effort to make sure you are performance-ready for gigs and showcase.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary> Q: What if I've already auditioned for NiCE?</summary>
        <p>No worries, there is no limit on the number of times you can audition for NiCE. In fact, several past and
          current members of NiCE are those who have auditioned multiple times before joining!</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary> Q: Does NiCE perform? </summary>
        <p>Normally, we are invited to perform at various gigs throughout the semester, and more recently,
          we have begun Sprouling (singing on Upper Sproul as people walk by on their way to class)! We also hold a
          showcase at the end of each semester.</p>
