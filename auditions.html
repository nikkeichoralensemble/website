        <h2>What does a typical week look like?</h2>
        <p>Our practices this semester will be on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 6-8 PM, as well as Saturdays
          at 4-6 PM. We will also be having a couple of in-person solo workshops with
          all members during the semester. During practice, we typically warm-up and learn and work on our
          music and choreo, as a group and also in sections. See our FAQ for more on performances!

        <h2>Frequently Asked</h2>

        <details>
          <summary> Q: Do I have to be Japanese to join? </summary>
          <p>Nope! And no Japanese language knowledge is necessary, either. </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary> Q: What does an audition entail? </summary>
          <p>We will ask you to come prepared with an excerpt of a song of your choice and an excerpt of a song of our
            choice.
            In addition, there will be a few basic warm-up and learning exercises.</p>
            <p>After you sign up for an audition slot, we’ll send you an email with more specific details :)</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary> Q: What if I don't know my vocal part? </summary>
          <p>We'll help you figure it out during the audition!</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary> Q: What if I don't have any prior experience? </summary>
          <p>No prior experience is required. We're all learning together. We just ask that you be willing to put in the
            effort to make sure you are performance-ready for gigs and showcase.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary> Q: What if I've already auditioned for NiCE?</summary>
          <p>No worries, there is no limit on the number of times you can audition for NiCE. In fact, several past and
            current members of NiCE are those who have auditioned multiple times before joining!</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary> Q: Does NiCE perform? </summary>
          <p>Normally, we are invited to perform at various gigs throughout the semester, and more recently,
            we have been looking to do Sprouls (basically, singing outside as people walk by on their way to
            class)! We also hold a showcase at the end of each semester.</p>
