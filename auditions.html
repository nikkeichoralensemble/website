    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h4> Q: Do I have to be Japanese to join? </h4>
    <p>Nope! And no Japanese language knowledge is necessary, either. </p>
    <h4> Q: What does an audition entail? </h4>
    <p>We will ask you to come prepared with an excerpt of a song of your choice and an excerpt of a song of our choice. In addition, there will be a few basic warm-up and learning exercises.</p>
    <h4> Q: What if I don't know my vocal part? </h4>
    <p>We'll help you figure it out during the audition!</p>
    <h4> Q: What if I don't have any prior experience? </h4>
    <p>No prior experience is required. We're all learning together. We just ask that you be willing to put in the effort to make sure you are performance-ready for gigs and showcase.</p>
    <h4> Q: What if I've already auditioned for NiCE?</h4>
    <p>No worries, there is no limit on the number of times you can audition for NiCE. In fact, several past and current members of NiCE are those who have auditioned multiple times before joining!</p>
    <h4> Q: Does NiCE perform? </h4>
    <p>This depends on the type of semester. Normally, we are invited to perform at various gigs throughout the semester and hold a showcase at the end of each semester. However, due to the pandemic, we have been unable to perform in person. Instead, we will be focusing on producing content that can be shared online!</p>
